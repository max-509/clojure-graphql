In-Out adjacency template.
It's simple representation of graph without data for matching subgraph structure.
Ii contains only list of Nodes and Links.
{:E {:in  [:A]
     :out [:B :D]}
 :B {:in  []
     :out [:B :D]}
 :C {:in  [:A]
     :out [:B :D]}}

This template contains part of all nodes, namely: [E B C], but there are also links to nodes from the full graph

There is function witch by graph and list of node construct this adjacency template
